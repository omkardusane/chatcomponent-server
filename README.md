# chatcomponent-server
Most important component for a social network based Mobile application/ business would be a chat component. This project is a full stack server implementation over Node.js + express.js + Socket.io for API end and MongoDB maintaining all the chat and user database. Client communication and real-time is implemented in java and Javascript both and also supports all the major languages as C#, Swift etc. The project is fully cohesive and works independently on a different server instance. I will be making it opensource in few months.
